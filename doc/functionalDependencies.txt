Functional Dependencies:

	1. We assume that all trivial functional dependencies speak for themselves in the schema
	section of our pdf.

	2. {city, addr} -> officeId

All relations satisfy First, Second, and Third Normal Form:
	1. no set valued attributes.
	2. no FD's such that X->A where A is a single non-prime attr.
	3. In the only Functional Dependency, the RHS is a prime attr and the FD is non-trivial.

*NOTE*:
	{city, addr} is not a superkey of office, thus Boyce-Codd Normal Form is not satisfied.
